A fun, easy-to-learn [collectible card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game) (CCG) that's free to collect for!

## The Problem

Many CCGs have high points. *Magic: the Gathering* (MTG), for example, provides a very  
interactive experience for the players, where one can make many different plays  
leading to different outcomes. *Yu-Gi-Oh* (YGO) features a great deal of deck searching,  
where the player may fetch specific cards to use, which helps to eliminate the sense  
of randomness that comes with drawing from a deck. However, not all is well. In MTG, one  
can fail to draw resources with which to play cards, or draw too many resources and not  
enough cards to play. In YGO, games are often won and lost in but a few turns, where a  
player has no time to prepare his or her defenses. Why is there not a card game that  
combines the best aspects of these wildly popular games, while avoiding their pitfalls?  

## Goals

We aim to create a fast, engaging play style that is heavy on decision making, and which  
eliminates some of the randomness of traditional CCGs by employing deck searching and by  
using a substantial amount of effects that allow players to draw cards.  

- Limit games to 10-15 minutes average play time
- Have decision making at every step of play
- Create a non-restrictive mana system
  - All cards will be usable for their effect, or as a resource.
- Involve a lot of deck searching and card drawing mechanics
